    <h1>The Sky Is So Blue</h1>
    <p>
        I didn't know <br>
        that the sky was so blue<br>
        We all linked hands and walked out<br>
        to look up at the sky together<br>
        This perfectly blue sky<br>
        The sky taught us<br>
        how to be kind<br>
        and how to never let go of our friends<br><br>

        I didn't know<br>
        that the sky was so blue <br>
        Why, I wonder, did I grow sad <br>
        When once I looked up at the sky alone <br>
        This deeply blue sky <br>
        The sky let us listen <br>
        to the song of clouds undefeated by the wind <br>
        So that we would no longer weep when alone <br>
    </p>
